What is the difference between var and let?
Ans: 
1. Variables declared with var can be accessed in the entire function they are defined, 
while those declared with let are limited only withing the block they are declared
2.  Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized. They can be accessed before 
their actual declaration, but their value is undefined untill the declaration is reached.
3. var create global scoped property : e.g var PI = 3.14;, console.log(window.PI); , where as 
let does not allow that to happen

What is the difference between var and const?
Ans:
1. const as well as let are block-scoped, limited to a particular block, while var is 
not limited, but can be accessed in the entire function. 
2. const variable cannot be redeclared and updated, while var can be re-declared and updated.

What is the difference between let and const?
1. let allows reassignment within a scope. reassignment in const is not possible. 

What is hoisting?
This is a process by which variable declaration are move to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

When you declare a function using the function keyword, the entire function (including its body) is hoisted to the 
top of its containing scope.

Example: 
sayHello(); // This works even though the function is defined later

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

- With Var, the variable name and its undefined value can be accessed before its declaration.
Example 2:
console.log(PI); //undefined
var PI = 3.4

- With let and const, their variable are hoisted within the scope of the block they are defined. 
if(true){
    let x = 5;
    console.log(x); // This give 5
}

console.log(x); //This will not work
